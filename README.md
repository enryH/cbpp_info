## Editing Hints
You can either edit online or offline using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
### Edit online an existing file on GitHub 
Without any prior setup on your local site, you can edit files directly on github, see the arrow on the screenshot below for 
[_pages/enryh](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/Website/blob/dev/_pages/people_henry.md):

![Screenshot Editing on GitHub](edit_on_github.png)

Once you click on it, you are able to edit and preview your changes. Saving is equal to making a commit.

If you want, you can also upload a picture to 
[_pages/image/your_name.png](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/Website/tree/dev/_pages/images) 
of yours and reference it in your page:

![Upload your Image](upload_your_image.png)

> you commit your changes to the branch you selected!

### Local file editing
- Follow the description in [setup.md](setup.md)
- Please create your own branch and then submit your changes using an pull request to the `dev`-branch

## Develop Website locally

Follow the instructions to install [**jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements) locally. 
Then you can develop your pages on the fly using. However, most editors have a markdown preview function,
which is more than enough to develop your personal site.

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

> Website is deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
