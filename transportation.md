# Transportation

## Bikes

Get a [bike](bikes.md) to move around in CPH!

## Public Transport

To use busses, trains or the metro in Denmark, you can buy tickets at the stations, on the [DOT app](https://dinoffentligetransport.dk/find-og-koeb-billet/salgssteder/dot-billetter-app/) **OR**, and this is the reommended option, you can get yourself a [Rejsekort](https://www.rejsekort.dk/).

### Rejsekort

With a Rejsekort, you will get discounts on tickets. You just have to top it up every now and then at metro stations. 
When you enter a metro station or a bus, you will have to check your Rejsekort in at one or the big, eluminated blue dots. Once you leave, you will have to check out and the ticket price will be deducted from your account.

#### Rejsekort Anonymous

An anonymous Rejsekort can be issued to anyone and you can let anyone use it. You will have to top it up at a station.

#### Rejsekort Personal

Once you've got a Nem-ID **(link to Nem-ID article)**, you can get yourself a personal Nem-ID. They can be linked with your bank account so that they are automatically topped up once your balance gets too low.
To one like these, you can also add a commuter area to your account. This is especially interesting for DTU students.

## Walking

Copenhagen is not a terribly big city so most of the time it is just fine to walk everywhere.
